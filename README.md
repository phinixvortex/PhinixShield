üöÄ PhinixShield

PhinixShield is a terminal-based SOC (Security Operations Center) tool with a central server and agent system.  
It allows live network monitoring, endpoint monitoring (CPU/RAM/Processes), and auto-blocking suspicious IPs.

‚ö° Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:phinixvortex/PhinixShield.git

cd PhinixShield

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


---

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running PhinixShield

Run the one-command launcher:

bash
./run_phinixshield.sh


What happens:

1. The server dashboard opens in a new terminal.  
2. The agent opens in a separate terminal and starts sending data.  
3. The dashboard updates live with:

- Network packets  
- CPU/RAM usage  
- Blocked IPs  
- Last 10 suspicious IPs

üñ•Ô∏è Server Commands

While the server terminal is active, you can type:

u <host> <ip>   -> Unblock an IP manually
g               -> Toggle CPU/RAM display
b               -> Toggle blocked IPs table
q               -> Quit the dashboard


---

üîπ Notes

- The agent requires sudo to block IPs via iptables.  
- Tested on Kali Linux / Ubuntu GNOME (for gnome-terminal). Adjust terminal commands if using XFCE or other environments.  
- Default max suspicious attempts is 10 before auto-blocking an IP.  
- Data is sent every 5 seconds from the agent to the server.
